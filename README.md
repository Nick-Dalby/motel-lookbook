## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

Single page image gallery built with React.
Features:
- custom cursor for navigation
- loading progress component
- responsive styles.

## Optimizations

I've just used local image files for this site but I could refactor the image comoponent to fetch these from any source and add an option to adjust the amount of images shown.

## Lessons Learned / Demonstrations of:

- custom cursor styling
- responsive image css
- array mapping
- handling navigation with useState
- the `<progress>` element âœ¨
